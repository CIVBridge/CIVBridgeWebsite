  <h2>Splartz: Air Pump Chair Stabilizer</h2>

  <p>
    The <strong>Splartz</strong> is a dynamic chair-stabilization platform designed to eliminate chair wobbling caused by uneven leg lengths, a common issue in student study environments. Aimed at enhancing comfort and usability in public academic spaces, Splartz targets square-legged chairs and incorporates an elastic air chamber that automatically adjusts to compensate for discrepancies between 1.25 mm and 12 mm. This passive adjustment system ensures that the platform dynamically conforms to uneven surfaces based on the user's weight distribution, delivering immediate and intuitive stabilization without requiring fixed installation or manual calibration.
  </p>

  <p>
    From a design standpoint, Splartz balances portability with robust performance. It supports weights up to <strong>150 kg</strong>, making it suitable for a wide range of users and furniture types. A key feature of the design is the use of a <strong>gyroid infill structure</strong>, chosen for its near-isotropic strength properties and superior material efficiency. This internal structure reduces material use while maintaining strength under load, optimizing the product for both cost-effective production and environmental sustainability. The form factor was also minimized by reducing platform height, which helped lower the center of gravity and enhanced overall stability. Safety was another critical focus; Splartz integrates <strong>rounded edges and recessed interfaces</strong> in compliance with NSPIRE safety standards, eliminating puncture or snag risks for users.
  </p>

  <p>
    The final concept was selected through rigorous evaluation using structured decision-making frameworks such as <strong>Pugh charts</strong> and <strong>measurement matrices</strong>, which helped the team converge on the air pump platform from among several competing designs. These tools allowed the team to analyze alternatives against core criteria including weight support, usability, safety, and correction accuracy. Splartz ultimately demonstrated a <strong>98% success rate in leveling performance tests</strong>, affirming the effectiveness of the selected concept. Through a design process rooted in empirical testing, iterative development, and thoughtful prioritization of user needs, the team produced a solution that is not only technically sound but also practical and accessible for deployment in real-world academic settings.

  <h2>CTMF 1: Using Standards to Frame Requirements</h2>

  <p>
    Integrating the <strong>NSPIRE safety standard</strong> (Figure 1) into our design process deepened my understanding of the <strong>framing phase</strong> of engineering. Framing involves defining what matters in a design — the problem, the goals, and the constraints. Initially, I thought of our project mainly in terms of stability and function. However, when we applied NSPIRE, our framing shifted: user safety became a priority. This required us to go beyond aesthetics and functionality to ensure we were addressing real-world risks like sharp edges and potential injuries.
  </p>

  <figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="Safety.png" alt="Figure 1 - NSPIRE Safety Standards" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #555;">
      Figure 1 – NSPIRE Safety Standard used to reframe requirements to adhere to safety
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    With this new framing, we created specific requirements: no exposed screws, no sharp corners, and all structural elements must be either enclosed or cushioned. These constraints forced us to rethink what “good design” meant — not just something that works, but something that protects. The safety requirement influenced every design decision from that point forward, guiding both our material choices and structural layouts.
  </p>

  <p>
    At first, I saw safety standards as a checklist item — something to deal with later. But framing our design around NSPIRE early on showed me how powerful these standards are in shaping initial thinking. They don’t just filter out bad ideas; they elevate the design by giving it purpose. We weren’t just building something functional — we were building something that met a professional expectation of responsibility.
  </p>

  <figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="gilde.png" alt="Figure 2 - Glide Reference" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #555;">
      Figure 2 – Glide design with rounded, NSPIRE-compliant edges
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Looking at existing glide designs (Figure 2), I saw how NSPIRE was applied in industry through subtle choices like rounded plastic, embedded fasteners, and covered metal ends. These examples helped me reframe our design more realistically. Rather than being restrictive, the safety framing gave our team a professional lens that connected our project to real engineering practice.
  </p>

  <p>
    Overall, this experience showed me that <strong>framing isn’t just about narrowing down a problem — it’s about deciding what values to prioritize</strong>. Applying the NSPIRE standard reframed our entire outlook, helping us balance performance with user-centered design from the very beginning. Framing our project through the lens of the NSPIRE standard proved highly effective in shaping a clear, user-centered foundation that guided every design decision with purpose and responsibility.

  <h2>CTMF 2: Diverging with the Lotus Method</h2>

  <p>
    Using the <strong>Lotus method</strong> (Figure 3) fundamentally shaped how I approach the <strong>divergence phase</strong> of engineering design. Divergence involves purposefully generating a wide range of ideas before evaluating or narrowing them down. Before this project, I often jumped to early conclusions and settled quickly on a “best” idea. However, the structured format of the Lotus method challenged me to slow down and fully explore the design space.
  </p>

  <figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="lotus.png" alt="Lotus Method Ideation Grid" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #555;">
      <strong>Figure 3:</strong> Lotus Method ideation grid used to diverge solutions across functional categories.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The method breaks down a central challenge into eight sub-problems and requires at least eight ideas per category. This forced our team to think deeply and broadly about the various aspects of our chair stabilizer, such as how to address load resistance, user ergonomics, ease of setup, and material performance. Generating over 60 unique ideas made me realize just how many possibilities can emerge when the goal is <strong>quantity over evaluation</strong>.
  </p>

  <p>
    One insight I gained from this method was that divergent thinking is not random — it thrives on structure. Instead of loosely brainstorming, the Lotus grid kept us anchored in specific themes. For example, under the “adjustability” category, we proposed spring-loaded arms, telescoping legs, and modular inserts. Each of these had different benefits, and none of them would have come to mind if we hadn't purposefully stretched our thinking through the framework.
  </p>

  <p>
    Another major learning was how collaboration expands divergence. The team setting meant each member offered ideas I wouldn't have generated alone — like a folding mechanism for portability or vibration-absorbing rubber composites for uneven ground. I learned that <strong>divergence works best when multiple perspectives are layered and built upon</strong>. Everyone’s contributions unlocked new sub-ideas, making the grid richer with each pass.
  </p>

  <p>
    Prior to this, I thought of brainstorming as a quick, optional step. But using the Lotus method made divergence feel intentional, rigorous, and necessary. It prevented us from fixating on our first idea and pushed us to find better, more creative options. This experience helped me understand that <strong>divergence isn’t a warm-up — it’s a core engineering skill</strong> that leads to better design by ensuring we’ve explored enough to make informed decisions later. The Lotus method was extremely effective in helping our team diverge thoughtfully and creatively, resulting in a broad, well-organized pool of ideas that laid the groundwork for strong and innovative design solutions.
  </p>

  <h2>CTMF 3: Converging with a Measurement Matrix</h2>

  <p>
    To make a reasoned and evidence-based design decision, our team employed a <strong>Measurement Matrix</strong> (Figure 4) as a convergence tool to compare the performance of each of our prototypes. This matrix was structured around six framing criteria that aligned directly with our project’s user needs and safety requirements — including weight support, risk of hazard, durability, and correction effectiveness. By doing this, we ensured the convergence process was not just a subjective selection but rather grounded in rigorous evaluation.
  </p>

  <figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="matrix.png" alt="Figure 4 - Measurement Matrix for Convergence" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 1rem; box-shadow: 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.75rem; font-size: 0.95rem; color: #555;">
      <strong>Figure 4:</strong> Measurement matrix used to compare prototypes against critical requirements.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The strength of this tool lies in its ability to <strong>integrate the framing and convergence phases</strong> of the design process. The framing phase was critical to this CTMF’s success: we defined a clear set of criteria rooted in stakeholder needs and real-world constraints, such as NSPIRE safety compliance (no sharp edges), load-bearing performance (150+ kg), and portability. This front-end framing ensured the convergence process would be anchored to meaningful metrics rather than arbitrary preferences.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through this matrix, we identified the <strong>Air Pump Platform</strong> as the optimal solution, which performed best across five out of six criteria. It provided high discrepancy correction (98%), the highest weight capacity (180 kg), full portability, and hazard-free edges. The Water-Filled Platform ranked closely behind, but was bulkier and risked maintenance issues. This comparative clarity would have been difficult to achieve without a structured convergence tool.
  </p>

  <p>
    Moreover, the matrix allowed us to <strong>visually represent complex tradeoffs</strong> and communicate our rationale clearly to stakeholders, including our instructors and peers. Instead of simply declaring a design winner, we could justify our choice through empirical performance, which increased confidence in our decision and aligned our direction with our initial problem framing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some may critique the Measurement Matrix as overly rigid or susceptible to bias in how criteria are weighted or interpreted. However, in our context, it created clarity and alignment. Because our framing process was well-developed and criteria were stakeholder-driven, the matrix served as a transparent and highly effective tool for convergence. It encouraged rational thinking, reduced group conflict, and brought structure to a process that could otherwise be subjective.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, integrating the Measurement Matrix as both a <strong>framing and convergence CTMF</strong> enhanced the professionalism and integrity of our design process. It enabled us to translate user needs into measurable goals, then systematically determine which design met those goals. This approach deepened my appreciation for structured engineering tools and reaffirmed the value of planning and analysis in design convergence.
  </p>

  <p><em>Effectiveness:</em> The Measurement Matrix was a highly effective CTMF in our design process, offering structured comparison, traceability of decision-making, and a clear link between user needs and final outcomes.</p>
</div>
<div class="section-container fade-section">
  <h2>Final Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    Praxis I fundamentally reshaped my understanding of engineering design by showing me that the process is far more than just building to meet technical function. Through our framing CTMF—using the <strong>NSPIRE safety standard</strong>—I realized that design begins by understanding the <em>people</em> and <em>contexts</em> our solutions serve. What once seemed like rigid constraints quickly became opportunities to align engineering goals with user well-being. Framing safety not just as a requirement, but as an integral part of the problem space, helped me recognize that good engineering must account for human needs from the outset—not as an afterthought.
  </p>

  <p>
    As we moved into ideation, the <strong>Lotus Method</strong> expanded my perception of collaboration and creativity. Diverging using this method taught me that innovation emerges when diverse perspectives are brought into a structured environment. I used to think of ideation as a solo activity—brainstorming in a vacuum—but Praxis I showed me that <em>designing with a team</em> often leads to stronger, more versatile solutions. Seeing how our ideas evolved from individual insights into a well-rounded, multi-faceted concept highlighted the importance of shared creativity in the early phases of design.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, our use of a <strong>Measurement Matrix</strong> to converge on a final concept showed me how critical objectivity and evaluation are in reaching design decisions. I’ve learned that effective engineering doesn’t rely solely on intuition or popularity—it’s driven by evidence, clear criteria, and iterative reflection. This systematic approach helped us choose the most balanced and realistic solution, reinforcing the importance of traceability in the design process. Altogether, Praxis I taught me to view engineering design as a thoughtful, user-centered, and team-driven practice grounded in ethical responsibility, critical thinking, and structured decision-making.

  <h2>CIV102 One-Pager Summary</h2>

  <p>
    “The KitKat Bridge” was designed to carry over 400 N of train load while optimizing strength-to-weight ratio, material efficiency, and structural performance. Our team focused on a strategic use of matboard materials and incorporated angled webs to improve stability under diagonal compression forces. By integrating a central underlayer beneath glue tabs, we increased the second moment of area (Ybar), leading to improved resistance against vertical bending. These design highlights reflected a direct response to the key opportunity: supporting significant loads within strict dimensional and material constraints.
  </p>

  <p>
    The construction process was guided by iterative analysis and value-driven decision making. Emphasis was placed on using diaphragm reinforcements and buckling calculations to position glue tabs and spike reinforcements effectively. We predicted that our bridge would fail in compression rather than shear or glue, and our test data confirmed that the FOS (factor of safety) remained ≥ 2 across all major failure modes. Careful fold scoring, glue width optimization, and material-efficient layouts further reinforced our structural performance, without compromising sustainability.
  </p>

  <p>
    Ultimately, the bridge reached a maximum load of 996 N before failure — more than double the required target. Our final design was not only structurally sound but also reflected strong teamwork, design intuition, and technical reasoning. By combining engineering principles with practical construction strategies, we produced a bridge that was both robust and efficient under load, demonstrating the successful outcome of our course-defined design challenge.

  <h2>CTMF 1: Diverging Through Classical Brainstorming</h2>

  <p>
    At the beginning of our bridge design process, our team engaged in <strong>classical brainstorming</strong> to generate a wide range of structural concepts before committing to a single design. Each team member contributed ideas individually, which we then shared openly to spark discussion and cross-pollination of insights. This method proved especially valuable in the early stages of the project when we needed to explore diverse approaches to meet the strength, stability, and weight constraints of the CIV102 Bridge Competition. The unfiltered nature of classical brainstorming encouraged creative freedom and allowed even unconventional ideas to be voiced without judgment.
  </p>

  <p>
    As a result of this collaborative ideation, we developed several bridge concepts which we later refined through calculations. Three of the most developed ideas are illustrated in Figures 1–3 below. These included a <strong>double-flanged I-beam design</strong> (Figure 1), a <strong>trapezoidal box-beam with multiple reinforcement levels</strong> (Figure 2), and an <strong>enhanced trapezoidal profile with four reinforcement axes</strong> (Figure 3). Once we had these initial ideas, we were able to evaluate each in terms of its moment of inertia, expected failure mode, and material usage. This mathematical validation process helped us see the tradeoffs between simplicity, manufacturability, and load-bearing performance.

    This CTMF was <strong>highly effective</strong> for the divergence phase of our bridge design. Classical brainstorming helped us create a broad solution space, from which we could later narrow down based on structural performance. Importantly, the act of sketching and discussing ideas visually accelerated our ability to convert concepts into analyzable models. Instead of defaulting to obvious beam shapes, we were able to iterate creatively and rigorously. Our team’s brainstorming session provided the foundation for everything that followed — it helped frame our understanding of the design possibilities and sparked the comparative calculations that drove us forward.

  <h2>CTMF 2: Converging Using a Measurement Matrix</h2>

  <p>
    As our team moved from ideation to analysis, we adopted a <strong>measurement matrix</strong> to guide our convergence process. Having brainstormed and modeled multiple structural configurations, including Design 0, Design 1, and the final candidate, we needed an effective CTMF to help us evaluate which design best satisfied our performance goals. The measurement matrix (Figure 4) allowed us to compare each design option across multiple <strong>factors of safety (FOS)</strong>, including tension, compression, shear, glue, and buckling in various forms. These values were obtained using structural calculations for each concept.
  </p>

  <p>
    For example, Design 0 (Figure 1) revealed a critical weakness in <strong>buckling resistance</strong>, falling below the acceptable FOS threshold of 1.0. This immediately signaled structural instability and made it a less viable candidate. In contrast, Design 1 (Figure 2) offered significantly better performance in buckling and tension but showed limitations in glue and overall consistency. 
  </p>

  </figure>

  <p>
    Ultimately, the <strong>final design</strong> (Figure 3) emerged as the most robust option, demonstrating consistent safety margins across all FOS categories. Notably, it had one of the highest FOSbuck123 values, showcasing superior structural stability under compressive and buckling stress. While the matrix alone did not dictate our decision, it <em>strongly influenced</em> our reasoning by pointing us toward the most balanced configuration. The visual clarity of the matrix (Figure 4) helped our team discuss and weigh the trade-offs in a transparent, structured format.

  <p>
    Using this CTMF not only facilitated convergence but also deepened our understanding of how comparative analysis strengthens engineering judgment. It allowed us to validate qualitative design ideas through quantitative evidence and uncover flaws that may have otherwise gone unnoticed. The matrix also helped us facilitate team discussion, enabling each member to weigh trade-offs transparently. This was especially useful when some metrics were strong in one design but weak in others, which led to meaningful conversations about what we value in structural integrity. Ultimately, the process emphasized the importance of <strong>structured evaluation</strong> over intuition, ensuring we chose a design supported by clear evidence and robust metrics.

  <h2>CTMF 3: Prototyping</h2>

  <p>
    Prototyping was a critical part of our CIV102 bridge design process, and we approached it through three distinct yet complementary stages: conceptual sketching, digital modeling, and full-scale physical construction. Each stage allowed our team to deepen our understanding of the bridge’s geometry, loading behavior, and practical constraints. We began by creating detailed engineering drawings (Figure 1), mapping out key dimensions and component layouts. These drawings helped us understand the relationships between elements such as the top span, underlayers, and diaphragm reinforcements, which later informed both calculations and build strategies.
  </p>

  <figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="drawing.png" alt="Figure 1 - Engineering Drawing of Final Bridge Design" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />

      <strong>Figure 1:</strong> Engineering drawing prototype used to finalize dimensions and construction strategy.
    </figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    Building upon these sketches, we transitioned into a digital prototype using Blender (Figure 2), which allowed us to visualize the bridge in three dimensions. This digital prototype helped identify spatial misalignments and provided insight into how the layers stacked during load application. Having the ability to rotate and inspect the bridge from multiple angles clarified certain doubts about load paths and joint placements. This model also facilitated team discussions, allowing all members to visualize the same reference before actual construction began.

      <strong>Figure 2:</strong> Blender model of the bridge provided a 3D reference to clarify spatial design.

  </figure>

  <p>
    Finally, we built the full-scale bridge using manila folders, glue, and reinforcement spikes. This physical prototyping stage (Figures 3–8) brought our conceptual and digital plans into reality. Each figure shows a different stage of the construction, from layering components to gluing and clamping the spans. The actual build allowed us to test tolerances, gain hands-on experience with material behavior, and refine our sequence of assembly. We realized the importance of precision and timing in gluing and how critical reinforcements were at load-bearing intersections. This CTMF proved invaluable in moving from theory to practice and closing the gap between idealized models and functional structures.

  <h2>Final Takeaways</h2>

  <p>
    Reflecting on the full design cycle for the CIV102 bridge project, I have come to better appreciate the structure and rigor of the engineering design process. Tools like classical brainstorming, measurement matrices, and iterative prototyping gave our team a way to convert raw creativity into tested, validated ideas. The process didn’t just help us choose a final design — it taught me how different CTMFs serve unique and necessary roles across the Frame–Diverge–Converge–Represent spectrum.
  </p>

  <p>
    Initially, I underestimated the importance of divergence and ideation. I often jumped to the "best idea" early on. However, after seeing how structured brainstorming led to designs we wouldn’t have otherwise considered, I recognized how critical this early phase is for uncovering innovation. Likewise, the convergence process using quantitative evidence showed me how to make more defensible design decisions — not based on intuition or convenience, but on real performance metrics.
  </p>

  <p>
    Finally, building and prototyping the bridge gave me a deep sense of respect for the link between design intent and physical reality. Even the most elegant plan needs iteration and testing before it becomes a reliable, tangible solution. Through this experience, I now see engineering design as more than technical execution — it’s an iterative, human-centered discipline rooted in thoughtful tradeoffs, teamwork, and reflective learning.

  <h2>Design Summary: Bonsai Bloom</h2>

  <p>
    <strong>Bonsai Bloom</strong> is a mobile application that quantifies soil moisture for Juniper bonsai trees by analyzing the color intensity of the soil surface through a smartphone camera. The app converts soil color to a hexadecimal code, compares it to an ideal "moisture" reference, and outputs a percentage indicating how wet or dry the soil is. This system is designed to help beginners care for bonsai trees by offering a simple, non-invasive method of moisture measurement that avoids disturbing the soil or roots.
  </p>

  <p>
    The design emphasizes <strong>accuracy, usability, and safety</strong>. By using RGB Euclidean distance between the current and ideal hex codes, Bonsai Bloom determines moisture with surprising effectiveness. The app features editable notes, pixel logs, and time-stamped entries to allow users to track changes over time. Experimental data confirmed the validity of the system: water loss in the soil followed a logarithmic trend with a strong correlation (R² = 0.924), and an inverted RGB intensity ratio also showed a high correlation with moisture over time (R² = 0.981).
  </p>

  <p>
    Going forward, potential improvements include adding a light source for consistent imaging, excluding root interference in readings, and extending functionality to other plant types. The simplicity and accessibility of the app demonstrate its strong alignment with the design brief—allowing beginner bonsai caretakers to monitor and adjust watering routines confidently while preserving soil structure. Ultimately, Bonsai Bloom combines practical image analysis and intuitive design to create an effective, user-friendly tool for plant care.

  <h2>CTMF 1: Framing through Primary Research</h2>

  <p>
    Our team began the Praxis II design process by actively engaging with the <strong>Toronto Bonsai Society</strong> to conduct <strong>primary research</strong> and understand the real needs of the bonsai community. This early interaction provided invaluable framing insights, especially around the needs of <strong>beginner bonsai enthusiasts</strong>—a demographic that stakeholders identified as needing the most support in plant care and moisture monitoring.
  </p>

  <p>
    Through our conversation with stakeholders, we learned that many new bonsai caretakers often struggle with overwatering or underwatering due to uncertainty and lack of intuitive feedback. As a result, we reframed our user group to focus specifically on <strong>novice users</strong>, shifting our design priorities to match their learning curve and usability needs. This reframing directly influenced our engineering requirements.
  </p>

  <p>
    One key outcome of this framing shift was the addition of a brand-new requirement: our design must <strong>minimize the number of steps</strong> the user needs to take to assess soil moisture. The aim was to improve overall usability and encourage continued engagement with the system, especially for users who might feel intimidated by traditional tools.
  </p>

    </p>
  </div>

  <p>
    This quote encapsulated our user-centered framing approach. By letting community voices drive the conversation, we were able to ground our technical goals in real-world insights. Rather than designing for the average user, we prioritized accessibility, simplicity, and beginner empowerment—reframing the problem not as one of moisture detection alone, but of user experience in plant care.
  </p>

  <p><em>Effectiveness:</em> This CTMF was highly effective because it redefined our target audience and expanded the problem space to include usability barriers. The primary research deepened our empathy for users, leading to better design decisions throughout the development cycle.</p>

  <h2>CTMF 2: Diverging with Biomimicry and Morph Chart</h2>

  <p>
    One of the most impactful diverging tools our team used during the design process was the combination of <strong>biomimicry</strong> and a <strong>morphological chart</strong>. These tools were key in helping us expand the design space and push beyond conventional solutions, ultimately giving rise to unique, viable concepts.
  </p>

  <p>
    We started with a biomimicry brainstorming session where we analyzed natural systems that manage water in efficient or adaptive ways. For instance, we looked at how <strong>cacti</strong> retain water through waxy cuticles and shallow, expansive root systems, and how <strong>moss</strong> conserves moisture by covering the topsoil. These insights didn’t stay abstract — they directly inspired functions in our design. The cactus led to ideas for <em>moisture-preserving containers and smart probes</em>, while moss influenced thoughts around <em>passive moisture retention layers</em>.
  </p>

  <p>
    We also took inspiration from biological structures like <strong>villi and cilia</strong>, which maximize surface area for absorption, and applied these to concept sketches for <em>hair-like moisture probes</em>. Even plant behaviors like <strong>stomata regulation</strong> and <strong>tree masting synchronization</strong> led us to brainstorm features like adaptive sensors and control comparisons based on moisture timing.
  </p>

  <p>
    Parallel to biomimicry, we used a morphological chart to map different functions of our system — such as <em>sampling soil</em>, <em>maximizing sensor contrast</em>, <em>measuring moisture</em>, and <em>quantifying saturation</em> — to multiple technological approaches. These included <strong>color scanning</strong>, <strong>capacitive/resistive probes</strong>, <strong>ultrasonic sensors</strong>, and <strong>gravimetric weight systems</strong>. Rather than locking into a single method, this process allowed us to mix and match ideas, and recognize the strengths of each approach.
  </p>

  <p>
    Together, biomimicry and the morph chart helped us explore over a dozen ideas that might not have emerged through traditional brainstorming. Importantly, this CTMF revealed that even partial ideas — like a concept inspired by “intraoral scanners” — could be refined or combined with others to generate practical, testable prototypes. Diverging in this way gave our team a creative and structured foundation from which to begin convergence.
  </p>

  <p>
    <em>Effectiveness:</em> This CTMF was highly effective because it allowed our team to draw from both biological inspiration and technical function mapping. The result was a much richer pool of ideas that enhanced creativity, deepened our understanding of nature-based engineering, and positioned us for stronger concept selection in the next phase.

  <h2>CTMF 3: Converging with Pugh Charts</h2>

  <p>
    In our Praxis II project, we used the <strong>Pugh Chart method</strong> (Figures 1–4) to guide the convergence phase and evaluate design alternatives with consistent, data-informed judgment. After generating a wide range of solutions during the divergent phase—including the Colour Scanner, Villi Probe, Sponge, and Claw—we needed a systematic method to compare them based on functional requirements like accuracy, number of steps, quantitative output, and corrosion resistance. The Pugh Chart provided a structured framework to organize this analysis, making it easier to draw meaningful comparisons across design options.
  </p>

  <figure style="text-align: center;">
    <img src="pugh1.png" alt="Pugh Chart using Colour Scanner as reference" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #555;">Figure 1 – Pugh Chart with Colour Scanner as the reference design</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The most effective Pugh Chart used the <strong>Colour Scanner as the reference</strong> (Figure 1), since it was our baseline idea and had already been used in previous tests. This reference allowed us to objectively identify the advantages and drawbacks of each competing design. The chart revealed that the Colour Scanner consistently outperformed other options in areas like accuracy, minimal user steps, quantitative feedback, and corrosion durability. It became clear that, despite being a complex tool, it provided a reliable, portable, and scientifically robust way to collect soil data, especially when combined with improved scanning strategies.
  </p>

  </figure>

    <img src="pugh3.png" alt="Pugh Chart using Sponge as reference" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" />
    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #555;">Figure 3 – Pugh Chart with Sponge as the reference design</figcaption>

    <figcaption style="margin-top: 0.5rem; font-size: 0.9rem; color: #555;">Figure 4 – Pugh Chart with Villi Probe as the reference design</figcaption>
  </figure>

  <p>
    The Pugh method was especially helpful during <strong>framing</strong> because it forced us to articulate and weight our evaluation criteria early in the process. We had to determine what attributes actually mattered in the context of field-based soil analysis: accuracy, user simplicity, corrosion resilience, and quantitative capability. This helped prevent us from selecting a design based on aesthetic appeal or subjective team preference. Instead, the Pugh Chart clarified which performance traits we prioritized and helped us frame our final selection accordingly.
  </p>

  <p>
    Evaluating the effectiveness of this CTMF, it is clear that the Pugh Chart method provided an accessible yet powerful tool for converging toward the best design option. It balanced qualitative judgment with quantitative rationale, encouraged critical discussion, and offered a visual summary that all team members could easily interpret. In the future, I would absolutely use this CTMF again—especially in group settings—because it keeps ideation grounded while still enabling consensus. Overall, this approach deepened my appreciation for convergence as a structured, evidence-based process rather than an arbitrary decision point.
